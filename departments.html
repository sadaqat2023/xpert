<p>We are embarking on an agenda to highlight and sustain the centrality of the arts in African American and African Diaspora Studies and its broader intellectual community. Look for programs with the Artist-in-Residence and our Black Arts Dialogues, and courses with our International Scholar-In-Residence and Postdoctoral Fellow emphasizing music, creative writing and visual arts. This is an exciting time of growth and opportunity for our department." âˆ’Kellie Jones, Chair-African American & African Diaspora Studies</p>
